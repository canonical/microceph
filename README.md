## 💡 Philosophy

Deploying and operating a Ceph cluster is complex because Ceph is designed to
be a general-purpose storage solution. This is a significant overhead for small
Ceph clusters. MicroCeph solves this by being _opinionated_ and _focused_ on
the small scale. With MicroCeph, deploying and operating a Ceph cluster is as
easy as a [Snap][snap-microceph]!

## 🎯 Features

* Quick and consistent deployment with minimal overhead
* Single-command operations (for bootstrapping, adding OSDs, service enablement, etc)
* Isolated from the host and upgrade-friendly
* Built-in clustering so you don't have to worry about it!

## ⚡️Quickstart

The below commands will set you up with a testing environment on a single
machine using file-backed OSDs - you'll need about 15 GiB of available space on
your root drive:

    sudo snap install microceph --channel quincy/edge
    sudo snap refresh --hold microceph
    sudo microceph cluster bootstrap
    sudo microceph disk add loop,4G,3
    sudo ceph status

You're done!

You can remove everything cleanly with:

    sudo snap remove microceph
