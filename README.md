MicroCeph is an opinionated orchestration tool for Ceph clusters at all scales.
It reduces the complexity of deploying and managing clusters by simplifying various operations like, service placement,
disk administration and remote replication via RESTful APIs and CLI commands.

Available as a snap, MicroCeph is the easiest tool for administrators, developers, and hobbyists to manage Ceph clusters.

## Installation

MicroCeph is delivered as a snap. On [snap-ready systems][snap-ready], you can install it on the command line with:

```
sudo snap install microceph
```

Disable automatic snap upgrades, so that no unexpected updates change your set-up:

```
sudo snap refresh --hold microceph
```

## Basic usage

MicroCeph can deploy a Ceph cluster on a single machine with minimal commands.

First, initialise a Ceph cluster on your machine with:

```
sudo microceph cluster bootstrap
```

> [!NOTE]  
> `cluster` is a MicroCeph subcommand for managing associated Ceph clusters.

After bootstrap, add storage to your cluster with:

```
sudo microceph disk add loop,4G,3
```

Here, you’ll add three virtual disks (“loop file” disks) of 4 GiB each. Make sure that your root disk has 12 GiB of free storage space.

Note that there are no spaces between the `disk add` arguments.

Once your cluster is set up and running, you can monitor its status with:

```
sudo microceph status
```

If you need a comprehensive status report of your cluster, including its health and disk usage, run:

```
sudo ceph status
```

> [!NOTE]
> MicroCeph supports the usage of Ceph native tooling where snap-level commands are not yet available.
