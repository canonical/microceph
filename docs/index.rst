MicroCeph
=========

MicroCeph is the easiest way to get up and running with Ceph.

MicroCeph is a lightweight way of deploying and managing a Ceph cluster. Ceph
is a highly scalable, open-source distributed storage system designed to
provide excellent performance, reliability, and flexibility for object, block,
and file-level storage.

Ceph cluster management is streamlined by simplifying key distribution, service
placement, and disk administration for quick, effortless deployment and
operations. This applies to clusters that span private clouds, edge clouds, as
well as home labs and single workstations.

MicroCeph is focused on providing a modern deployment and management experience
to Ceph administrators and storage software developers.
