Report security vulnerabilities
===============================


.. important::
 
   Please don't open a public GitHub issue for security problems.

The easiest way to report a security issue is through
`GitHub <https://github.com/canonical/snap-openstack/security/advisories/new>`_. See
`Privately reporting a security vulnerability <https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability>`_ for instructions.

The repository admins will be notified of the issue and will work with you
to determine whether the issue qualifies as a security issue and, if so, in
which component. We will then handle figuring out a fix, getting a CVE
assigned and coordinating the release of the fix.

The `Ubuntu Security disclosure and embargo policy`_ contains more
information about what you can expect when you contact us, and what we
expect from you.
