Report security vulnerabilities
===============================


How to report
-------------

*Please don't open a public GitHub issue for security problems.*

1. *Open a Private Security Report* in the MicroCeph repository `here <https://github.com/canonical/microceph/security/advisories>`_
2. Include:

   * Description of the issue and why it's a security risk
   * Reproduction steps
   * Affected versions and environment details (OS, arch, deployment mode)
   * Impact assessment (who can exploit it, required privileges, data at risk)
   * Mitigations/workarounds if you know any
   * Your contact info for follow-up
3. If you can't use Private Security Reports, follow the contact route described in the `Ubuntu Security disclosure and embargo policy`_ with details on reporting via Launchpad or via email.


What to expect
--------------

We intend to provide an initial response to reporters within two
business days.

The Ubuntu Security Team can assign CVE numbers for issues in
Canonical software, as well as anything shipped in Ubuntu. We may
direct the reporter to use cveform.mitre.org for publicly known issues
in non-Canonical software to avoid duplicate assignments.

For issues that are not yet publicly known, we will abide by any
embargoes as necessary. We reserve the right to release fixes before
an embargo has expired if other parties disclose the issue before the
agreed upon embargo date or if there is evidence of abuse.

We may or may not provide further information to reporters about
similar issues. We may or may not ask reporters to collaborate on
solutions or work-arounds. We may or may not ask reporters for
assistance testing solutions or work-arounds.

We are not affiliated with any bug bounty programs. We do not
ourselves pay for bug reports, in either our software or our
infrastructure.

We are happy to give credit to reporters in our CVE assignments and in
our Ubuntu Security Notices. We will use real names of discoverers,
with no affiliations, in our USNs.

For more process details and expectations on disclosure/embargo, see
the `Ubuntu Security disclosure and embargo policy`_.
